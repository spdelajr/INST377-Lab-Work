            Here are my 5 favorite albums, that are not actually my favorite albums but I do not know any albums so I just asked my friends instead.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melodrama by Lorde, interesting album name, also funny name for a singer 10/10.
            </li>
            <li>
                Little Oblivions by Julien Baker, the album cover is solid nothing great about this but nothing terrible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Woman on the Internet by Oria Gartland, again with the high quality name.
            </li>
            <li>
                Abbey Road by Beatles, people talk about the beatles a lot so I bet this is pretty good.
            </li>
            <li>
                Merry Perry Christmas by Perry Andanar, a banger christmas album that my friend released in high school, I would rank it as pretty good.
            </li>

            Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.

Let's Try Some Inline Elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

Images 

Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."
