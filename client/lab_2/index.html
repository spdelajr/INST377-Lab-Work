            <li>
                HTML and CSS
            </li>

            Here are my 5 favorite albums, that are not actually my favorite albums but I do not know any albums so I just asked my friends instead.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melodrama by Lorde, interesting album name, also funny name for a singer 10/10.
            </li>
            <li>
                Little Oblivions by Julien Baker, the album cover is solid nothing great about this but nothing terrible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Woman on the Internet by Oria Gartland, again with the high quality name.
            </li>
            <li>
                Abbey Road by Beatles, people talk about the beatles a lot so I bet this is pretty good.
            </li>
            <li>
                Merry Perry Christmas by Perry Andanar, a banger christmas album that my friend released in high school, I would rank it as pretty good.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    </div>

    <div class='section_2'>
        <h2 class='subtitle'>
            Let's try some inline elements
        </h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes you want to <em><strong>do both</strong></em>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class='section_3'>
        <h2>
            Empty Elements
        </h2>
        <p>
            Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br/>Neither can image tags or hard lines.<br/>Add a hard line under here, and break the previous two lines using a soft line break.
        </p>
